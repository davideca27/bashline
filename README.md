# Bashline, the bash theme ðŸ‘Œ
Bashline is a bash theme that was inspired by the powerline / powerlevel10k for bash lovers like me. Bashline uses NerdFont to be more cooler than others bash themes. Bashline focuses on speed and productivity.
Actually, Bashline was made do be used in [Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page), but i want to port this for another unix-like systems.
## How to install?
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davideca27/bashline/main/bashline_installer.sh -O $HOME/bashline_installer.sh \
    && bashline_installer.sh
```
### âš  Warning
